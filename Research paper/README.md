## Abstract
Parity games are often used for the formal verification of software systems and for the μ-calculus model-checking problem, but reasoning about them is generally hard. Multiple algorithms solve parity games, but none of them do so in polynomial-time, even though it is widely believed that a polynomial algorithm exists. In this paper, we show that it is possible to model one such algorithm, _priority promotion_, as a series of graph transformations, and describe how to do it. Subsequently, we use these graph transformations to visualise the algorithm in the formal graph transformation tool _Groove_, with the goal to provide researchers with a better understanding of parity games. We also model several extensions to the algorithm using recursion and non-determinism. Finally, we reflect on the results and suggest directions for future research.
